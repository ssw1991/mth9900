Earnings per diluted share were $1.48 for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, compared with earnings of $1.62 per diluted share for the same period last year. Sales for the 2005 second quarter were a record $816.3 million, up 7%, compared with 2004 second quarter sales of $760.8 million. There was no LIFO income or expense recorded in the 2005 second quarter, compared with a pre-tax LIFO expense amount of $32.5 million, or $.60 per diluted share in the 2004 second quarter. For the six-months ended June 30, 2005, net income amounted to a record $95.4 million, up 16% compared with net income of $82.6 million for the same period in 2004. Earnings per diluted share were $2.89 for the six-months ended June 30, 2005, compared with earnings of $2.54 per diluted share for the six-months ended June 30, 2004. Sales for the 2005 year-to-date period were a record $1.63 billion, an increase of 15% compared with 2004 six-month sales of $1.42 billion. The 2005 six-month financial results include in cost of sales a pre-tax LIFO expense amount of $12.5 million, or $.23 per diluted share, compared with $60 million, or $1.12 per diluted share in the 2004 year-to-date period. David H. Hannah, Chief Executive Officer, said, "During the second quarter we did not see any meaningful changes, up or down, in the demand for our products when compared to the prior quarter. Our product diversification continues to play an important role in our financial results. Our toughest challenge during this last quarter was managing through the decrease in carbon steel pricing, which we expect to continue throughout the 2005 third quarter. "We continue to believe that the operating environment, while changing, is still very favorable by historical standards, and we are encouraged by the opportunities we see for continued growth for our Company. At this time, anticipating no significant changes from existing business conditions, but expecting some softness in pricing to continue, we estimate earnings per diluted share for the 2005 third quarter will be in a range of $1.20 to $1.30," concluded Hannah. In July of 2005, Reliance acquired Chapel Steel Corp., headquartered in Spring House (Philadelphia), Pennsylvania for $94.2 million in cash plus the assumption of approximately $16.8 million of debt. Chapel was a privately held metals service center company founded in 1972 specializing in high-strength carbon and alloy plate. Chapel's net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 were approximately $273 million. Also during the second quarter, the Company entered into a $600 million, five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced its previous $335 million credit facility. The Company plans to use its credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes, internal growth initiatives, and the funding of acquisitions. On April 20, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $.09 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on June 3, 2005 to shareholders of record May 13, 2005. The Company has paid regular quarterly dividends for 45 consecutive years.

(2)See Consolidated Statements of Income for reconciliation of EBIT and EBITDA. EBIT is defined as the sum of income before interest expense and income taxes. EBITDA is defined as the sum of income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation expense and amortization of intangibles. We believe that EBIT and EBITDA are commonly used as a measure of performance for companies in our industry and are frequently used by analysts, investors, lenders and other interested parties to evaluate a company's financial performance and its ability to incur and service debt. EBIT and EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The items excluded from EBIT and EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. EBIT or EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity. (3)The December 31, 2004 balances have been adjusted to reflect balance sheet reclassifications made as of June 30, 2005. (4)Net debt-to-total capital is calculated as total debt (net of cash) divided by shareholders' equity plus total debt (net of cash). (5)Calculations are based on the latest twelve months.
